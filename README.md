## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Crystal** (version 0.34.0 or higher)
- **Redis** (version 5.0 or higher recommended)

### Quick Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (for development):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azutoolkit/joobq.git
   cd joobq
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   shards install
   ```

3. **Start Redis** (if not already running):

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

## Installation

Add the following to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  joobq:
    github: azutoolkit/joobq
```

Then run:

```crystal
shards install
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "joobq"
```

### Environment Variables

```crystal
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_POOL_SIZE=500
REDIS_POOL_TIMEOUT=5.0
REDIS_PASS=somepass
REDIS_TIMEOUT=0.2
```

### Configuration

JoobQ can be configured using the `JoobQ.configure` method. Here is an example configuration:

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do
  queue "default", 10, EmailJob

  scheduler do
    cron("*/1 * * * *") { # Do Something }
    every 1.hour, EmailJob, email_address: "john.doe@example.com"
  end
end
```

### Configuration Properties

The `JoobQ::Configure` struct provides several properties that can be customized to configure the JoobQ system:

- `default_queue`: The name of the default queue. Defaults to `"default"`.
- `retries`: The number of retries for a job. Defaults to `3`.
- `expires`: The expiration time for a job. Defaults to `3.days`.
- `timeout`: The maximum execution time allowed for a job. Defaults to `2.seconds`.
- `failed_ttl`: The time-to-live for failed jobs. Defaults to `3.milliseconds`.
- `dead_letter_ttl`: The time-to-live for jobs in the dead letter queue. Defaults to `7.days`.
- `job_registry`: An instance of `JobSchemaRegistry` for managing job schemas.
- `store`: The store instance used for job storage and retrieval. Defaults to `RedisStore`.

### Example Configuration with All Properties

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do |config|
  config.default_queue = "default"
  config.retries = 5
  config.expires = 2.days
  config.timeout = 5.seconds
  config.failed_ttl = 1.minute
  config.dead_letter_ttl = 14.days

  queue "default", 10, EmailJob
  queue "priority", 5, PriorityJob, throttle: { limit: 100, period: 1.minute }

  scheduler do
    cron("*/1 * * * *") { # Do Something }
    every 1.hour, EmailJob, email_address: "john.doe@example.com"
  end
end
```

### Defining Queues

Queues are of type Hash(String, Queue(T)) where the name of the key matches the name of the Queue.

**Example:**

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do
  queue name: "single", workers: 10, job: Job1, throttle: { limit: 20, period: 1.minute }
  queue "example", 10, ExampleJob | FailJob

  # Scheduling Recurring Jobs
  scheduler do
    cron("*/1 * * * *") { # Do Something }
    cron("*/5 20-23 * * *") { # Do Something }
    every 1.hour, ExampleJob, x: 1
  end
end
```

### Queue Throttling

The worker throttle mechanism in JoobQ works in conjunction with the Queue Throttle Limit property to manage the rate at
which jobs are processed. Here's how it works:

#### Queue Throttle Limit Property

The Queue Throttle limit property sets a maximum number of jobs that can be processed within a specific time frame. This
helps to control the load on the system and ensures that the job processing rate does not exceed a certain threshold.

#### How They Work Together

- **Job Availability and Throttle Limit:** The worker checks the queue for available jobs. If the number of jobs processed
  within the specified time frame reaches the throttle limit, the worker will wait until it is allowed to process more
  jobs. This prevents the system from being overwhelmed by too many jobs at once.

- **Job Expiration:** Before processing a job, the worker checks if the job has expired. If the job has expired, it is
  marked as expired and not processed. This ensures that only valid jobs are processed, reducing unnecessary work.

- **Controlled Shutdown:** The worker can be stopped gracefully by sending a termination signal. This allows for a
  controlled shutdown, ensuring that no jobs are abruptly terminated.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how you might configure the Queue Throttle limit property:

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do
  queue "default", 10, EmailJob, throttle: { limit: 100, period: 60.seconds }
end
```

In this example, the throttle limit is set to 100 jobs per 60 seconds. This means that the worker will process up to 100
jobs every 60 seconds. If the limit is reached, the worker will wait until the next period to continue processing jobs.

#### Summary

The worker throttle mechanism, combined with the Queue Throttle limit property, ensures that job processing is controlled
and efficient. By managing job availability, expiration, and processing rate, JoobQ provides a robust system for
handling job queues without overwhelming the system.

### Defining Jobs

To define Jobs, include the JoobQ::Job module, and implement the perform method.

```crystal
struct EmailJob
  include JoobQ::Job

  # Name of the queue to be processed by
  @queue   = "default"
  # Number Of Retries for this job
  @retries = 0
  # Job Expiration
  @expires = 1.days.total_seconds.to_i

  # Initialize as normal with or without named tuple arguments
  def initialize(@email_address : String)
  end

  def perform
    # Logic to handle job execution
  end
end
```

**Executing Job:**

```crystal
# Enqueue the job (Async)
EmailJob.enqueue(email_address: "john.doe@example.com")

# Batch enqueue jobs
EmailJob.batch_enqueue([job1, job2, job3])

# Perform Immediately
EmailJob.new(email_address: "john.doe@example.com").perform

# Delayed
EmailJob.delay(for: 1.hour, email_address: "john.doe@example.com")
EmailJob.enqueue_at(time: 3.minutes.from_now, email_address: "john.doe@example.com")

# Recurring at given interval
EmailJob.schedule(every: 1.second, email_address: "john.doe@example.com")
```

#### Best Practices for Defining Jobs

When defining jobs in JoobQ, it's important to follow certain best practices to ensure reliability and maintainability. Here are some key recommendations:

##### Idempotency

Jobs must be idempotent. This means that running the same job multiple times should produce the same result. Idempotency is crucial for ensuring that jobs can be retried safely without causing unintended side effects. To achieve idempotency:

- Avoid modifying external state directly within the job.
- Use unique identifiers to track job execution and prevent duplicate processing.
- Ensure that any side effects (e.g., database updates, API calls) are safe to repeat.

##### Simple Primitive Types for Arguments

Job arguments must be simple primitive types such as integers, strings, and booleans. This ensures that the job data can be easily serialized and deserialized, and reduces the risk of errors during job execution. Complex objects or data structures should be avoided as job arguments.

##### Number of Arguments

Keep the number of arguments for jobs to a minimum. Having too many arguments can make the job definition complex and harder to maintain. As a best practice:

- Limit the number of arguments to 3-5.
- Group related arguments into a single object if necessary.
- Use default values for optional arguments to simplify job invocation.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your jobs are reliable, maintainable, and easy to work with in the JoobQ framework.

## JoobQ HTTP Server

The `APIServer` class provides a REST API to interact with the JoobQ job queue system. It listens for HTTP requests and handles job enqueuing, job registry retrieval, and queue metrics.

To start the API server.

```crystal
APIServer.start
```

### Rest API
