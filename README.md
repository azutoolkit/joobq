### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Crystal** (version 0.34.0 or higher)
- **Redis** (version 5.0 or higher recommended)

### Quick Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (for development):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azutoolkit/joobq.git
   cd joobq
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   shards install
   ```

3. **Start Redis** (if not already running):

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

## Installation

Add JoobQ to your project's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  joobq:
    github: azutoolkit/joobq
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
shards install
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Require JoobQ in your application:

```crystal
require "joobq"
```

### Environment Variables

Configure Redis connection using environment variables:

```bash
REDIS_HOST=localhost           # Redis server host
REDIS_PORT=6379                # Redis server port
REDIS_POOL_SIZE=500            # Connection pool size
REDIS_POOL_TIMEOUT=5.0         # Pool checkout timeout (seconds)
REDIS_PASS=your_password       # Redis authentication password
REDIS_TIMEOUT=0.2              # Command timeout (seconds)
```

### Configuration

JoobQ uses a declarative configuration API. Configure your queues, jobs, and schedulers in a single block:

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do
  queue "default", 10, EmailJob

  scheduler do
    cron("*/1 * * * *") { puts "Running scheduled task" }
    every 1.hour, EmailJob, email_address: "admin@example.com"
  end
end
```

### Configuration Properties

The `JoobQ::Configure` struct provides comprehensive customization options:

| Property          | Type                | Default          | Description                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `default_queue`   | `String`            | `"default"`      | Default queue name for jobs              |
| `retries`         | `Int32`             | `3`              | Number of retry attempts for failed jobs |
| `expires`         | `Time::Span`        | `3.days`         | Job expiration time                      |
| `timeout`         | `Time::Span`        | `2.seconds`      | Maximum job execution time               |
| `failed_ttl`      | `Time::Span`        | `3.milliseconds` | TTL for failed jobs                      |
| `dead_letter_ttl` | `Time::Span`        | `7.days`         | TTL for dead letter queue jobs           |
| `job_registry`    | `JobSchemaRegistry` | Auto             | Job schema registry instance             |
| `store`           | `Store`             | `RedisStore`     | Storage backend for job persistence      |

### Complete Configuration Example

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do |config|
  # Global settings
  config.default_queue = "default"
  config.retries = 5
  config.expires = 2.days
  config.timeout = 5.seconds
  config.failed_ttl = 1.minute
  config.dead_letter_ttl = 14.days

  # Define queues with worker allocation
  queue "default", 10, EmailJob
  queue "priority", 5, PriorityJob, throttle: { limit: 100, period: 1.minute }

  # Schedule recurring jobs
  scheduler do
    cron("*/1 * * * *") { puts "Heartbeat check" }
    every 1.hour, EmailJob, email_address: "admin@example.com"
  end
end
```

### Defining Queues

Queues in JoobQ are strongly typed collections that map queue names to their respective job types. Each queue is configured with a specific number of worker processes to handle job execution.

**Queue Definition Syntax:**

```crystal
queue name : String, workers : Int32, job_types : JobType, throttle : NamedTuple?
```

**Examples:**

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do
  # Single job type queue with throttling
  queue "emails", 10, EmailJob, throttle: { limit: 20, period: 1.minute }

  # Multiple job types using union types
  queue "processing", 10, ExampleJob | FailJob

  # High-priority queue with more workers
  queue "critical", 50, CriticalJob

  # Schedule recurring jobs
  scheduler do
    cron("*/1 * * * *") { puts "Minute task" }
    cron("*/5 20-23 * * *") { puts "Evening task" }
    every 1.hour, ExampleJob, x: 1
  end
end
```

### Queue Throttling

JoobQ provides sophisticated rate limiting to prevent system overload and ensure controlled job processing. The throttling mechanism operates at the queue level, allowing you to define precise limits for different types of workloads.

#### Throttle Configuration

Throttling is configured using a `NamedTuple` with two properties:

- **`limit`**: Maximum number of jobs to process within the time period
- **`period`**: Time window for the limit (using Crystal's `Time::Span`)

#### Throttling Behavior

**Rate Limiting**

- Workers monitor job processing rates in real-time
- When the limit is reached, workers pause until the next period begins
- Prevents downstream service overload and API rate limit violations

**Job Expiration**

- Workers automatically check job expiration before processing
- Expired jobs are marked and moved to the dead letter queue
- Prevents wasted resources on stale operations

**Graceful Degradation**

- Workers can be stopped gracefully without job loss
- In-flight jobs complete before shutdown
- Unprocessed jobs remain in the queue for the next worker

#### Throttling Example

```crystal
JoobQ.configure do
  # Limit to 100 emails per minute
  queue "emails", 10, EmailJob, throttle: { limit: 100, period: 1.minute }

  # API calls limited to 1000 per hour
  queue "api_calls", 5, APIJob, throttle: { limit: 1000, period: 1.hour }

  # High-throughput queue with no throttling
  queue "analytics", 20, AnalyticsJob
end
```

#### Best Practices

- Set throttle limits based on downstream service capacity
- Monitor queue depth to ensure throttling isn't too aggressive
- Use separate queues for different rate limit requirements
- Consider peak load scenarios when setting limits

### Defining Jobs

Jobs in JoobQ are Crystal structs that include the `JoobQ::Job` module. Each job must implement a `perform` method containing the business logic to execute.

#### Job Structure

```crystal
struct EmailJob
  include JoobQ::Job

  # Queue assignment
  @queue = "default"

  # Retry configuration
  @retries = 3

  # Job expiration (in seconds)
  @expires = 1.day.total_seconds.to_i

  # Type-safe initialization
  def initialize(@email_address : String)
  end

  # Business logic implementation
  def perform
    # Send email logic here
    puts "Sending email to #{@email_address}"
  end
end
```

#### Job Execution Methods

JoobQ provides multiple ways to execute jobs based on your timing requirements:

**Immediate Execution**

```crystal
# Asynchronous (enqueue for background processing)
EmailJob.enqueue(email_address: "user@example.com")

# Synchronous (execute immediately in current context)
EmailJob.new(email_address: "user@example.com").perform
```

**Batch Operations**

```crystal
# Enqueue multiple jobs atomically
jobs = [
  EmailJob.new(email_address: "user1@example.com"),
  EmailJob.new(email_address: "user2@example.com"),
  EmailJob.new(email_address: "user3@example.com")
]
EmailJob.batch_enqueue(jobs)
```

**Delayed Execution**

```crystal
# Delay by duration
EmailJob.delay(for: 1.hour, email_address: "user@example.com")

# Schedule for specific time
EmailJob.enqueue_at(
  time: 3.minutes.from_now,
  email_address: "user@example.com"
)
```

**Recurring Jobs**

```crystal
# Execute at regular intervals
EmailJob.schedule(
  every: 1.hour,
  email_address: "admin@example.com"
)
```

#### Best Practices for Defining Jobs

Follow these guidelines to create robust, maintainable jobs that work reliably in production environments.

##### 1. Idempotency

**Jobs must be idempotent.** Running the same job multiple times should produce identical results without adverse side effects.

**Guidelines:**

- Design jobs to check for existing state before making changes
- Use unique identifiers to track job execution
- Implement conditional logic to handle duplicate processing
- Ensure database operations use upsert patterns where appropriate

**Example:**

```crystal
def perform
  return if already_processed?(@email_address)

  send_email(@email_address)
  mark_as_processed(@email_address)
end
```

##### 2. Use Simple Primitive Types

**Job arguments should be primitive types:** strings, integers, booleans, and floats. This ensures reliable serialization and deserialization.

**Recommended:**

```crystal
def initialize(@user_id : Int64, @email : String, @send_copy : Bool = false)
end
```

**Avoid:**

```crystal
# Don't pass complex objects
def initialize(@user : User, @config : Config)  # ‚ùå
end
```

##### 3. Minimize Arguments

**Limit job arguments to 3-5 parameters** for better maintainability and readability.

**If you need more data:**

- Store related data in your database and pass only the ID
- Use a single reference identifier to fetch related data within the job
- Consider breaking the job into smaller, focused jobs

**Example:**

```crystal
# Good: Pass ID and fetch data in perform
struct UserNotificationJob
  def initialize(@user_id : Int64, @notification_type : String)
  end

  def perform
    user = User.find(@user_id)
    # Process notification
  end
end
```

##### 4. Error Handling

Implement proper error handling and logging within your jobs:

```crystal
def perform
  # Job logic
rescue ex : Exception
  Log.error { "Job failed: #{ex.message}" }
  raise ex  # Re-raise to trigger retry mechanism
end
```

## JoobQ HTTP Server

JoobQ includes a built-in HTTP server providing a RESTful API for job management, monitoring, and system introspection. The API enables external applications to interact with the job queue system programmatically.

### Starting the API Server

```crystal
require "joobq/api_server"

JoobQ::APIServer.start(host: "0.0.0.0", port: 8080)
```

### Core API Endpoints

#### GET /joobq/jobs/registry

Retrieve the complete registry of available job types with their JSON schemas. This endpoint is useful for API clients to understand job requirements and generate validation logic.

**Request:**

```http
GET /joobq/jobs/registry HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Accept: application/json
```

        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["user_id", "message"]
  }
}
```

#### POST /joobq/jobs

Enqueue a new job for asynchronous processing.

**Request:**

```http

  Storage:        SSD
  Redis Version:  7.0+
```

### Performance Characteristics

**Concurrency Model**

- Leverages Crystal's lightweight fibers for efficient concurrent processing
- Minimal memory overhead per job
- Non-blocking I/O operations

**Optimization Features**

- Redis pipelining for batch operations
- Connection pooling to minimize latency
- Efficient serialization/deserialization
- Zero-copy job passing where possible

### Important Considerations

**Performance is Environment-Dependent**

While JoobQ delivers exceptional out-of-the-box performance, actual throughput depends on multiple factors:

- **Hardware**: CPU cores, memory, and storage performance
- **Network**: Redis connection latency and bandwidth
- **Job Complexity**: Computation time and I/O operations within jobs
- **Configuration**: Worker count, connection pool size, and throttling settings
- **System Load**: Concurrent processes and resource availability

**Optimization Recommendations**

For production deployments:

1. Profile your specific job workloads
2. Tune worker counts based on job characteristics
3. Optimize Redis configuration for your use case
4. Monitor system metrics and adjust accordingly
5. Use throttling to prevent resource exhaustion

**Benchmark Methodology**

These benchmarks measure simple no-op jobs to evaluate framework overhead. Real-world performance will vary based on actual job complexity and system integration.
